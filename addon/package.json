  "description": "The Konveyor Add-on for Amazon EKS Blueprints enables organizations embarking on their modernization journey. It follows a simple yet effective approach of surfacing the information about the application to aid a ‘Decision Maker’ to make decisions about their modernization and migration needs, plan the work in the form of ‘Migration waves’ and provide guidance to the developers to complete the needed migration/modernization by providing assets as well as a catalog of integrated tools to aid specific workflows.",
